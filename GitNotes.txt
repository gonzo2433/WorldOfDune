Git command examples
====================
# clone repo at specified url
git clone https://github.com/gonzo2433/WorldOfDune.git
                  
# show status (displays unstaged files and if your local repo is ahead or behind the main server repo)
git status

-------- staging files ---------
git add hello2.cpp
# stage hello2.cpp

git add .
# stage all files (that are not listed in .gitignore)


-------- commiting staged files (to local repo) ---------
git commit -m "commit description"


git commit -a -m "commit description"
# use this to skip the add commnds. stage and commit all changes (that are not listed in .gitignore)
# the 'git status' commands should be used prior to make sure that all changed files should actually be added. 
# the .gitignore file should be modified if the file list contains temporary build files or folders(.pch, .obg, .tlog, bin, release)
#



# update local repository with any changes on server. Make sure you are clean before pulling.  (no uncommited local changes)
git pull


-------- show local changes -------
git diff

-------- undoing uncommitted changes ---------
# remove all staged files
git restore --staged .

# remove staged file foo.txt
git restore --staged foo.txt



# discard all local changes and revert files back to state before you modified them
git restore .


-------- undoing  committed changes
#undo last commit, use 'git log' to display commit history and hash values
git revert <hash-value>

# reset HEAD **Danger** use only for undoing local commits,  revert is preferred and safer
git reset --soft HEAD~1


--------- branching ------------
git branch my-branch
# create new branch named my-branch

git checkout my-branch
# switch to branch named my-branch


#list configuration
git config --list
